*1 How the JPM runs your code is chapters 2 and 3.

*2 How the JVM manages memory in chapters for 3 to 10.
  Good understanding of how memory works in Java the role of the stack and the heap and how memory is allocated and so on 
  and we'll see that there are opportunities to change a number of defaults.
  
*3 Garbage collection in Chapters 11 through to 15.
  optimization techniques from programming choices that might help us minimize the need for garbage collection through to 
  selecting the most appropriate garbage collection algorithm for our specific needs and even shooting how the algorithm works.
  
*4 Evaluating code performance in Chapter 16 to 19.

*5 Chapter 20 :Understanding can help us make good choices about the right type of collection to use for our 
   specific needs.

*6 Maps in Chapter 21 and then in chapter 22 some other coding issues and whether they impact memory and 
   performance.

*7 Chapter 23 explores the graph VM project an exciting replacement for the JVM which should lead to some significant performance improvements.

*8 Chapter 24 will understand how to evaluate whether some of the other JVM languages such as Scala cotton in groovy 
  enclosure perform better or worse than Java.
